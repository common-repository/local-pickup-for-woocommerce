=== Store-Specific Pickup Fees and Discounts: ===
Admins can apply fees or discounts for individual store pickups. This feature helps reduce shipping time and costs by encouraging customers to pick up products from specific locations.

Merchants can require pickup for large or important items to simplify shipping. With new selectors for product and category pickup availability, you can designate products as "pickup only" or "shipping only," ensuring appropriate handling and delivery.
